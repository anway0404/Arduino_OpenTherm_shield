## Hardware Requirements

To get started, you will need the following hardware:

- An Arduino board (Uno, Mega, etc.)
- OpenTherm Shield
- Jumper wires
- Power supply for Arduino

## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE (version 1.8.5 or later)
- KiCad (for PCB design modifications)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anway0404/Arduino_OpenTherm_shield.git
   cd Arduino_OpenTherm_shield
   ```

2. **Open the Project in Arduino IDE**
   - Open the Arduino IDE.
   - Select File > Open and navigate to the cloned repository.

3. **Install Libraries**
   - Make sure to install any necessary libraries for OpenTherm communication.

## Usage

Once you have installed the required libraries, upload the example sketch to your Arduino board. Modify the code as necessary to suit your specific needs.

### Example Code Snippet

```cpp
#include <OpenTherm.h>

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  // Initialize OpenTherm communication
}

void loop() {
  // Read data from OpenTherm devices
}
```
